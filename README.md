## Project Structure

This repository includes the following:

* **`FinancialAnalysis.pbix`** (or whatever you named your Power BI Desktop file) - The main Power BI report file.
* **`README.md`** - This file, providing an overview of the project

This project demonstrates the following Power BI skills:

* **Data Importing:** Successfully connecting to and importing data from a Google Sheets source.
* **Data Preprocessing (ETL):** Cleaning and transforming the dataset using Power Query Editor to ensure data quality. (Mention specific steps you took, e.g., data type conversions, handling missing values if any, creating calculated columns).
* **Data Visualization:** Creating a minimum of 7 insightful visuals to represent different aspects of the financial data. (You can briefly list some of the visuals you created, e.g., Total Gross Sales by Country map, Profit by Product bar chart, Sales Trend over Time line chart).
* **Interactive Elements:** Incorporating buttons for navigation, bookmarks to save specific report views, and relevant images to enhance the user experience.
* **Report Organization:** Designing a well-organized report with clear titles, consistent formatting, and intuitive navigation.
* **Insightful Analysis:** Deriving meaningful insights and identifying key trends or patterns within the financial data. (This section will be expanded below).

## Insightful Analysis

*Paseo product is more profitable product.
* USA contributed the most to gross sales.
* There is linear increment is observed in sales or profit over time.
* There is weak positive correlation between average manufacturing price and sales price,manufacturing costs influence sale prices, other factors also play a significant role.
* "Government" segment is the most profitable, while the "Enterprise" segment is incurring losses. This highlights the importance of understanding segment-specific dynamics to optimize profitability.
